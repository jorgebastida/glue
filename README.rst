Is your company using glue?
---------------------------
We are creating a list of companies using glue in production. If your company use ``glue``, please send `me <mailto:me@jorgebastida.com>`_ an email or send me a message to `@jorgebastida <https://twitter.com/jorgebastida>`_ . I would really appreciate it.


We need your help
------------------

There are several features that ``glue`` users would love to have... but they require a substancial amount of work and dedication, so we are looking for feature-sponsors! If you want to lead the development/testing of any of the following features, please contact `Jorge Bastida <mailto:me@jorgebastida.com>`_.

Here you have some examples:

* Windows support (I'm not a Windows user, ``glue`` needs somebody who care about how ``glue`` works on Windows and write down some installation instructions).
* Cocos2d Format (Already exists, but we need somebody to give it some love).
* New Formats (After 0.9, ``glue`` is ready to accept new output formats - If you want to create a new format, contact me).
* Binary packaging for OSX and Windows (For some users it would be really cool if they were able to download an already packaged binary version).
