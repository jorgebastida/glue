0.9.1
^^^^^^
* Fix issue with cocos2d output format #131 (Thanks lzubiaur).

0.9
^^^
* This version solves lots of design flaws glue had since it was created two years ago. At the very beginning, glue was created as a single-file script to create css sprites. After two years of development, an outstanding support from the community and an incredible support from lots of companies it's time to refurbish glue from its foundations ensuring it lasts over time.
* This version introduce a new concept named ``Formats``. Every output file generated by glue now is created using a format. This change decouples glue's core (as far as possible) from how the output is created allowing glue developers to create different formats without messing glue's core. Fixing #64
* Glue now support two new output formats (cocos2d, json and CAAT). CSS will still be the default output.
* New project layout, algorithms formats and manager now have their own packages.
* Glue now uses ``argparse`` instead of ``optparse``.
* Glue now requires ``Pillow>=2.2``. Fixing #99
* Glue now requires ``Jinja2>=2.7``.
* Glue now uses utf-8 as default encoding for css files. #65
* New (fully rewritten) test suite and test framework in order to make writing tests easier.
* ``--margin`` now supports more than only one margin, you can now use it with (e.g.) ``--margin=10 20 10 20``. Fixes #101
* New ``setup.py`` fixing #110
* New options ``--source`` and ``--output`` will now complement the first and second positional argument.
* New option ``--css-template`` will allow you to choose your own css output `jinja template <http://glue.readthedocs.org/en/latest/templates.html>`_.
* New option ``--scss`` will use ``scss`` as file extension instead of ``css``. Fixing #86
* New option ``--json-format`` will allow to customize the json structure generated by ``--json``.
* New feature: Every settting is now configurable using `environment variables <http://glue.readthedocs.org/en/latest/settings.html>`_ and `configuration files <http://glue.readthedocs.org/en/latest/files.html>`_.
* New option ``--pseudo-class-separator=_``.
* Glue now support multiple css pseudo-classes applied to the same image #87.
* Glue css pseudo-class separator is now ``__`` instead of ``_``. If you want to make ``glue`` work in legacy mode use the new option ``--pseudo-class-separator=_``.
* Glue will not validate css output if ``--no-css`` is present #78.
* Glue CSS media-queries now includes ``min-resolution`` See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries#-moz-device-pixel-ratio.
* Several bugs fixed like #70 #93 #94 #108 #109 #110 #115

* This version includes **several** backward incompatible changes - **read this document carefully before upgrading**.

  - Glue will **not** extract padding information from filenames. If you want to customize paddings individualy (per image), you should use `configuration files <http://glue.readthedocs.org/en/latest/files.html>`_.
  - ``--imagemagick`` and ``--imagemagickpath`` are now deprecated. These options were introduced as a workaround in order to solve some scaling glitches caused by ``PIL``. Pillow ``2.2.0`` solves these issues.
  - ``--each-template``, ``--global-template`` and ``--ratio-template`` are now deprecated. CSS output customization can be easily done now using ``--css-template=template.jinja``.
  - ``--ignore-filename-paddings`` is now deprecated. Per-file customization can be easily (and more scalably) done now using configuration files.
  - ``--optipng`` and ``--optipngpath`` are now deprecated. There are lots of png optimization libraries and it would be silly to support all of them. Feel free to optimize your png files using your favourite one.
  - ``--debug`` is now deprecated. If an unhandled Exception is triggered, glue will now automatically show some friendly debug information.
